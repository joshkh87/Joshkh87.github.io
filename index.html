            I believe in the notion of social entrepreneurship, I belive that corperations have a social responsibility to not only their employees, but to their community and to people as a whole. Making the world a better place and being the change you want to see in the world. I personally belive in complete Inclusivity on every aspect of society. I believe that racism/bigotry on any level are absolutely wrong and unacceptable, I Do Not and Will Not stand for it. I absolutely belive in human rights and equality for all. Civil rights are human rights and everybody no regardless of race, gender affiliation, creed, religion, country of origin or lifestyle deserve to have those rights.
